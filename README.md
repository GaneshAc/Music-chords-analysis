# Music-chords-analysis
chorrrds is a package to retrieve and analyse music data. chorrrds is a new package, with a lot of potential and many possible applications to be explored. 
I used Janis Joplin songs as an example of how the extraction is done. Presented a brief analysis of the music chords, along with a chord diagram.

Note: - Here we can clearly see how the transitions behave in the songs weâ€™re using. 
There are strong connections between the chord A and E, A and B, and the others one are, in general, fragmented.
